# Cookbook #
I'm learning a bit about typescript.  This may turn into a cookbook if
I keep on with it.

Dependencies
------------
Clone this repo:
`git clone git@github.com:ianplunkett/cookbook.git`

Then at the top level, install the node dependencies:
`cd cookbook && node install`

This project relies on typescript. To use typescript across projects, run the following: `npm install -g typescript`
